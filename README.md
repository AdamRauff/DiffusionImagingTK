Registration. It is designed to work with the ITKv4
modular system and  to be places it ITK/Modules/External or uses as a
Remote module.

This modular a collection of tools written to allow for analsysis of diffusion weighted
magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI / DWI).

It currently supports streamline fibertracking using the following single-shell diffusion models
* DTI (fit using least squares, weighted least squares or residual bootstrap)
* standard ODF
* solid angle ODF (fit using least squares or residual bootstrap)
